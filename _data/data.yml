profile: |
  Decade long Unix lover and user, I spend my professional time as well as my personal
  time improving the deployability and availability of systems through automation, be it
  for a client's sake or for my own. My other main interest is computer security, more
  specifically, bug hunting and exploitation in source code or closed-source binaries.
